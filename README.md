# ${1:Combat Models}
A growing collection of Python implementations of mathematical combat models used in operational research. Meant to accompany the explanations published in the blog 'Damn the Torpedoes!' at http://wwww.doolanshire.net
## Installation
Unless stated otherwise, the models are just single-file, mostly self-contained Python scripts. Here is a list of dependencies so far:
- NumPy (Lanchester Linear, Lanchester Square)
- Matplotlib (all models)
## Usage
Again unless stated otherwise, just input the variables for the combat you wish to model, and run the script. Each script should produce an inline plot of the combat process as a function of time.
## Contributing
The scripts here collected are merely for research, with no form or function goals other than being practical in mathematically describing combat situations according to existing OR models. That said, it is entirely possible that some of them might have mistakes in a few untested cases. Should you notice one such mistake, and be able to fix it, your contribution would be greatly appreciated! Feel free to suggest any changes you find appropriate.
