# PARSER FUNCTIONS #
####################

# These functions open and parse the external files needed for the model to run.
# The files contain model settings, battle data, fleet lists, gun specifications etc.
# Please note that the Royal Navy's 1921 model is relatively simple and it only uses
# a small fraction of the information in the input files. Other wargame rule sets,
# such as the Naval War College's 1922 Maneuver Rules, may use all parameters.

    fires at which), its members (as a string of comma-separated ship names) and its type
    ('capital' for battleships and battlecruisers, 'light' for groups made up of light division
    ships). This last distinction is important because the Royal Navy's 1921 rules use different
    equations to determine equivalent hitting power for the two: capital ship guns are all converted
    to 15-inch hits, and light division guns are all converted to 6-inch hits. These two equations
    are not compatible, so the model cannot really compare the relative firepower of groups of

    - Groups outnumbering their target group fire with a penalty to their accuracy as defined in the 1921 rules.
    - When firing, each individual ship in the group fires in turn, targeting only the enemy ships it can damage.
    - Damage is distributed among all target ships proportionally to their remaining staying power. In other words,
    all target ships are aggregated into one for damage purposes.

    Note that the same ship can be registered in more than one group. A ship may receive fire as part of a large
    group and individually (in a different one-ship group) during the same battle. Hence, in this simulation,
    aggregation is not the norm, but merely another tool at the user's disposal.

        - status: a fraction indicating the level of damage received by a ship. A value of 1 means the ship is intact,

    Methods:

        to incorporate another ship mid-battle this would be the way to do it.

        in the firing group use its fire() method and distributes damage among all the ships in the target group,
        proportional to their remaining hit points. See the Ship class fire() method for more information.
