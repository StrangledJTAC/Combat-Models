# Chase's Continuous Fire Equation
A quick implementation of J.V. Chase's Continuous Fire Equation, as formulated in a classified paper in 1912. The model was built from the accurate description provided by Wayne P. Hughes Jr. in his 1995 paper *The Value of Warship Attributes in Missile Combat*.

## Description
J.V. Chase's Continuous Fire Equation is a differential equation describing the attrition suffered by two opposing fleets. It is essentially an earlier version of Lanchester's Square Law (and one unknown to Lanchester, as it was classified) with the addition of a *staying power* parameter describing the amount of damage that each ship in the fleet can sustain before being taken out of action.
