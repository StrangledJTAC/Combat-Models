# Lanchester's Square Law with Reinforcements
An implementation of Lanchester's Square Law, as postulated by Frederick W. Lanchester in his work *Aircraft in Warfare*, 1916.

This version offers the possibility to specify reinforcements arriving for each side at arbitrary moments of the battle. The course of the action is plotted using Matplotlib.

Refer to each function's docstring for instructions.

## Description

Two files are included:

* **lanchesterLogic.py**: contains the two classes (_Side_ and _Battle_) used by the model.
*  **lanchesterBattle.py**: provides an example implementation of a model of the Battle of Trafalgar, as offered by W.P. Fox in the Proceeding of the 20th ICTCM in 2009.

### Dependencies
Numpy and MatPlotLib required.
