# FIRE EFFECT TABLES

### FOR NAVAL WAR COLLEGE WARGAMES


The [Naval War College wargame](https://usnwc.edu/Research-and-Wargaming/Wargaming), in its interwar and WWII iterations, estimates the effects of naval gunfire in various conditions by consulting _fire effect tables_ created for every major naval gun model.

The NWC produced ample documentation on how to generate these tables from the existing gun range tables produced by the Bureau of Ordnance. Some of these can be found in the late [Gene Slover's web site](https://www.eugeneleeslover.com/USN-GUNS-AND-RANGE-TABLES/USN-GUNS-AMMUNITION-DESIGN-AND-TESTING.html) â€“ now maintained by a friend of his.

These tools aim to make the process of generating the fire effect tables from the range tables easier.

## Objectives

The full fire effect tables for every gun model used in both world wars don't always exist, and when they do they're often difficult to find. These tools aim to:

- Extrapolate missing values from incomplete range tables
- Generate fire effect tables fro use in the wargame from complete range tables
- Obtain plausible fire effect tables for the more exotic guns and calibres by interpolation

CSV files are used for both input and output.
